---

### 2. PRD.md Core Quality

#### Requirements Coverage (4/4 passed - 100%)

✓ **Functional requirements describe WHAT capabilities (not HOW to implement)**
Evidence: PRD.md L38-61 describe capabilities without implementation:
- FR001: "Support dynamic loading" (what) not "Use dlopen()" (how)
- FR010: "Synchronize parameter changes to audio routing" (what) not "Call applyRoutingChanges()" (how)

✓ **Each FR has unique identifier**
Evidence: All FRs numbered FR001-FR018 (L39-61)

✓ **Non-functional requirements have business justification**
Evidence: NFR001-NFR007 (L64-71) include rationale:
- NFR001 "< 1ms latency overhead" - essential for real-time audio
- NFR007 "1000+ downloads month 1" - community growth metric

✓ **Requirements are testable and verifiable**
Evidence: All requirements include measurable criteria:
- FR010: "< 1 sample block latency" (measurable)
- NFR001: "< 1ms latency overhead" (measurable)
- NFR005: "16/16 unit tests passing" (verifiable)

#### User Journeys (3/3 passed - 100%)

✓ **User journeys reference specific FR numbers**
Evidence:
- Journey 1 (L76-85): References FR011, FR015, FR018, FR003, FR016, FR017, FR012, FR014
- Journey 2 (L87-96): References FR011, FR008, FR012, FR014, FR001
- Journey 3 (L98-107): References FR011, FR005, NFR003, FR003

✓ **Journeys show complete user paths through system**
Evidence:
- Journey 1: Download → Develop → Test → Submit → Feedback → Distribution → Usage (complete cycle)
- Journey 2: Discovery → Install → Use → Browse → Install algorithm → Use (complete user flow)
- Journey 3: Platform 1 → Platform 2 → State transfer → Consistency → Sharing (multiplatform experience)

✓ **Success outcomes are clear**
Evidence:
- Journey 1: "Average algorithm development time reduced from 1 day to 2 hours" (L85)
- Journey 2: "Time from discovery to first use < 5 minutes" (L96)
- Journey 3: "<1% platform-specific bug reports; 90%+ cross-platform satisfaction" (L106)

#### Strategic Focus (3/3 passed - 100%)

✓ **PRD focuses on WHAT and WHY (not technical HOW)**
Evidence: PRD describes capabilities and rationale, not implementation details. Example: FR010 (L49) says "synchronize parameter changes" not "modify MenuSystem::updateParameterValue()"

✓ **No specific technology choices in PRD**
Evidence: PRD mentions VCV Rack (required platform), but doesn't specify internal tech choices. Technical details appropriately in epics (e.g., epics.md L82-88 shows implementation options)

✓ **Goals are outcome-focused, not implementation-focused**
Evidence: Goals section (L12-19) focuses on outcomes: "Complete DistingNT Feature Emulation", "Enable Algorithm Ecosystem", "Build Developer Community"

---

### 3. epics.md Story Quality

#### Story Format (3/3 passed - 100%)

✓ **All stories follow user story format**
Evidence: All stories include "As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]":
- Story 1.1 (L51-54): "As a parameter-tweaking musician, I want parameter changes to apply to audio routing instantly, So that I experience zero lag..."
- Story 1.2 (L121-124): "As a new developer joining the team, I want to understand all major architectural decisions..."
- Story 2.1 (L236-239): "As a Linux user, I want to download and use DistingNT plugin..."

✓ **Each story has numbered acceptance criteria**
Evidence: All stories include numbered AC:
- Story 1.1: 7 acceptance criteria (L67-74)
- Story 1.2: 7 acceptance criteria (L183-191)
- Story 2.1: 7 acceptance criteria (L248-255)

✓ **Prerequisites/dependencies explicitly stated**
Evidence: All stories include prerequisites:
- Story 1.1: "None (builds on existing architecture)" (L93)
- Story 1.2: "None (pure documentation)" (L195)
- Story 2.1: "Story 1.1, 1.2 complete" (L258)

#### Story Sequencing (4/5 passed - 80%)

✓ **Epic 1 establishes foundation - Exception noted for brownfield**
Evidence: epics.md L41 explicitly notes: "This is a brownfield project at 92% completion. Epic 1 completes final features and documentation rather than establishing initial infrastructure foundation, as core architecture is already in place and validated."

✓ **Vertical slices: Each story delivers complete, testable functionality**
Evidence:
- Story 1.1: Complete feature (parameter sync) with validation gates (L96-113)
- Story 1.2: Complete deliverable (technical-decisions.md) with validation (L197-213)
- Story 2.1: Complete platform support (Linux) with integration tests (L260-273)

✓ **No forward dependencies: No story depends on work from a LATER story or epic**
Evidence: All prerequisites reference earlier work:
- Epic 1 stories have no dependencies or previous Epic 1 dependencies
- Epic 2 stories depend on Epic 1 (Stories 2.1, 2.2 require 1.1, 1.2)
- Epic 3 is planned/outlined, dependencies not yet detailed

⚠ **PARTIAL: Stories are sequentially ordered within each epic**
Evidence:
- Epic 1: Sequential (1.1 → 1.2)
- Epic 2: Mostly sequential, but Stories 2.1 and 2.2 (Linux/Windows builds) could run in parallel since both depend on 1.1/1.2 but not each other
- Impact: LOW - parallel stories are beneficial for efficiency, not a sequencing violation

✓ **Each story leaves system in working state**
Evidence: All stories include validation gates confirming working state:
- Story 1.1: "make clean && make" + "make test" (L97-101)
- Story 2.1: "make clean && make" + "make test" + "vcvrack DistingNT_test.vcv" (L262-273)

#### Coverage (2/2 passed - 100%)

✓ **All FRs from PRD.md covered by stories in epics.md**
Evidence:
- FR001-FR010: Covered in Epic 1 (existing implementation + Story 1.1 for FR010)
- FR011: Covered in Epic 2 Story 2.5 (plugin registry submission)
- FR012-FR014: Explicitly noted as deferred to Epic 3 (L148-150, L584-597)
- FR015, FR017: Covered in Epic 2 Story 2.6 (documentation)
- FR016, FR018: Deferred to Epic 3 (L584-597)

✓ **Epic list in PRD.md matches epics in epics.md**
Evidence:
- PRD Epic 1 (L135-138) matches epics.md Epic 1 (L30-214)
- PRD Epic 2 (L140-146) matches epics.md Epic 2 (L217-572)
- PRD Epic 3 (L148-156) matches epics.md Epic 3 (L575-597)

---

### 4. Cross-Document Consistency (4/4 passed - 100%)

✓ **Epic titles consistent between PRD.md and epics.md**
Evidence:
- PRD L135: "Epic 1: Finish DistingNT Feature Emulation"
- epics.md L30: "Epic 1: Finish DistingNT Feature Emulation"
- (Same for Epics 2 and 3)

✓ **FR references in user journeys exist in requirements section**
Evidence: All FR/NFR references in journeys (L76-107) exist in requirements (L38-71)

✓ **Terminology consistent across documents**
Evidence: Consistent use of "DistingNT", "algorithm", "VCV Rack", "plugin", "emulator" throughout both documents

✓ **No contradictions between PRD and epics**
Evidence: Epic scope and descriptions align with PRD requirements and vision

---

### 5. Readiness for Next Phase (2/2 passed - 100%)

**Project Level 3 from bmm-workflow-status.md:**

✓ **PRD provides sufficient context for solution-architecture workflow**
Evidence: PRD includes comprehensive context:
- Technical Considerations section references existing architecture docs (L174: architecture-vcv-plugin.md, architecture-emulator.md)
- Clear requirements (L38-71) for architectural planning
- Integration context with existing systems (PRD L174)

✓ **Epic structure supports phased delivery approach**
Evidence:
- Epic 1: Foundation completion (1 week, 2 stories)
- Epic 2: Production release (3 weeks, 8 stories)
- Epic 3: Ecosystem expansion (4 weeks, planned)
- Clear value delivery path: Complete features → Release → Grow ecosystem

✓ **Clear value delivery path through epic sequence**
Evidence:
- Epic 1 delivers: 100% feature parity, technical foundation (L138)
- Epic 2 delivers: Production-ready plugin, community infrastructure (L145-146)
- Epic 3 delivers: Thriving community, 50+ algorithms, 5000+ users (L155)

---

### 6. Critical Failures (0/7 - All Passed)

✓ **No epic.md file missing** - epics.md exists

✓ **Epic 1 establishes foundation** - Exception properly noted for brownfield project (epics.md L41)

✓ **Stories have no forward dependencies** - All dependencies reference earlier work

✓ **Stories are vertically sliced** - Each delivers complete, testable functionality

✓ **No technical decisions in PRD** - Technical details appropriately in epics (e.g., epics.md L82-88)

✓ **Epics cover all FRs** - All FRs mapped to Epic 1, 2, or 3

✓ **User journeys reference FR numbers** - All journeys include FR/NFR references

## Failed Items

**None** - No critical failures identified

---

## Partial Items

### ⚠ PARTIAL: Stories sequentially ordered within each epic

**Status:** Acceptable with explanation

**Evidence:**
- Epic 1: Fully sequential (1.1 → 1.2)
- Epic 2: Stories 2.1 and 2.2 (Linux/Windows builds) could run in parallel
- Both depend on Epic 1 (1.1, 1.2) but are independent of each other

**Impact:** LOW - This is actually a BENEFIT for efficiency, not a defect

**Recommendation:** Consider updating epic documentation to explicitly note which stories can be parallelized:
```markdown
**Epic 2 Parallelization Opportunities:**
- Stories 2.1 (Linux) and 2.2 (Windows) can run concurrently
- Story 2.3 (CI/CD) depends on both 2.1 and 2.2
```

### ⚠ PARTIAL: Epic 3 story details incomplete

**Status:** Acceptable - Epic 3 is planned/outlined

**Evidence:** epics.md L586-597 shows "Planned Stories (outline only)" with story titles but not full details

**Impact:** LOW - Epic 3 is future phase, full details not needed yet

**Recommendation:** Before starting Epic 3, expand stories using create-story workflow as noted in epics.md L636

### ⚠ PARTIAL: Some FR coverage deferred to Epic 3

**Status:** Acceptable with clear documentation

**Evidence:**
- FR012-FR014 (algorithm ecosystem features) deferred to Epic 3
- FR016, FR018 (example algorithms, API docs) deferred to Epic 3
- PRD L146 explicitly notes: "Algorithm ecosystem features (FR012-FR014, FR016) deferred to Epic 3"

**Impact:** LOW - Intentional scoping decision, clearly documented

**Recommendation:** Ensure Epic 3 stories fully cover FR012-FR014, FR016, FR018 when expanded

---

## Recommendations

### Strengths

1. **Exceptional Requirements Quality**: All FRs testable, well-scoped, clearly written
2. **Strong User Journey Mapping**: Complete paths with FR traceability and success metrics
3. **Vertical Story Slicing**: Each story delivers working, testable functionality
4. **Clear Epic Sequencing**: Logical progression from completion → release → ecosystem
5. **Brownfield Awareness**: Appropriately acknowledges 92% completion status
6. **Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria**: Every story has 5-7 specific, measurable AC
7. **Validation Gates**: All stories include executable validation commands

### Must Fix

**None identified**

### Should Improve

1. **Parallelization Documentation**: Add explicit note in Epic 2 about Stories 2.1/2.2 parallelization opportunity
2. **Epic 3 Expansion**: Before starting Epic 3, expand planned stories to full detail level

### Consider

1. **Story Estimation Validation**: Stories estimated at 1.5-4 hours - consider time-tracking to validate estimates
2. **Risk Documentation**: Epic 2 includes complex cross-platform work - consider adding risk section to Epic 2
3. **Success Metrics Tracking**: Define how NFR007 metrics (1000+ downloads, 5000+ users) will be tracked

---

## Validation Status

**⚠ APPROVED FOR NEXT PHASE WITH MINOR ENHANCEMENTS**

Both PRD and epics documents are high-quality and ready for solution-architecture workflow. The partial items identified are acceptable given the project context (brownfield, phased delivery).

**Next Steps:**
1. ✅ Proceed to solution-architecture workflow (Epic 1/2 ready)
2. Consider documenting parallelization opportunities in Epic 2
3. Before Epic 3: Expand planned stories to full detail level

**No blocking issues - documents are production-ready**
