## Key Differences: Orchestra vs BMAD

### Orchestra (Orchestration Tool)
- Discovers epics from `/docs/prd/epic-N.md` files
- Reads story files from `/docs/stories/`
- Expects `Status: Ready for Development` format
- Epic titles from epic file headers
- Used for: Running stories, progress tracking, orchestration

### BMAD (Workflow Framework)
- Uses epic files for workflow context
- Story creation workflow generates stories
- Different templates but compatible format
- Used for: Story creation, context injection, workflow execution

### Integration
Both tools work together:
- BMAD creates stories → Orchestra runs them
- Epic files serve both frameworks
- Story files compatible with both systems

---

## Usage Commands

### Orchestra Commands

```bash
# View progress report
orchestra report

# View specific epic
orchestra report --epic 1

# Filter by status
orchestra report --status "Ready for Development"

# Run a story
orchestra run 1.1

# Run multiple stories
orchestra run 1.1 1.2

# Get JSON output
orchestra report --json
```

### BMAD Workflows

```bash
# Create story with context
/bmad:bmm:workflows:story-context

# Implement story with AI
/bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story

# Review completed story
/bmad:bmm:workflows:review-story
```

---

## Validation

```bash
# Verify Orchestra recognizes project
cd /Users/nealsanche/nosuch/nt_emu
orchestra report

# Expected output:
# ✅ 3 epics with proper titles
# ✅ 10 stories
# ✅ All "Ready for Development"
# ✅ Epic 1: "Finish DistingNT Feature Emulation"
# ✅ Epic 2: "Multiplatform VCV Plugin Release"
# ✅ Epic 3: "Algorithm Ecosystem Expansion"
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Epic Documentation Structure ✓
- **Before:** Epic files in `/docs/epics/` (incorrect location)
- **After:** Epic files in `/docs/prd/` (correct location matching no_such_verb)
- **Result:** Orchestra now displays epic titles correctly

### 2. Epic File Format ✓
- **Before:** Extended documentation format
- **After:** Standard epic template with Epic ID, Status, Priority, Effort, Duration
- **Result:** Matches no_such_verb format, properly structured

### 3. Story Status Format ✓
- **Before:** "Ready for Implementation" (invalid)
- **After:** "Status: Ready for Development" (valid)
- **Result:** All 10 stories recognized correctly

### 4. Directory Cleanup ✓
- Removed `/docs/epics/` directory
- Consolidated to `/docs/prd/` for epics
- Maintained `/docs/stories/` for story files

---

**Status:** ✅ Orchestra integration complete and validated
**Epic Titles:** All displaying correctly
**Stories Ready:** 10/10 (100%)
**Blocking Issues:** None
**Next Step:** Ready to run `orchestra run 1.1` to begin Story 1.1 implementation
