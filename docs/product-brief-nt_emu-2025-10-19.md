# Product Brief: NT_EMU - Disting NT Desktop Emulation Platform

**Project**: nt_emu
**Version**: 2.0.0
**Author**: Neal Sanche (No Such Device)
**Date**: October 19, 2025
**Status**: Production-Ready, Actively Maintained

## Executive Summary

NT_EMU is a production-ready VCV Rack module that emulates the Expert Sleepers Disting NT hardware synthesizer module. It enables developers to create, test, and debug Disting NT algorithm plugins on desktop computers without requiring expensive hardware, while allowing musicians to use algorithmic DSP modules within the VCV Rack ecosystem. The platform has evolved into a hybrid development framework demonstrating AI-assisted development methodologies alongside core plugin functionality.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
The Disting NT is a powerful but specialized eurorack module with a steep development barrier:
- **High Entry Cost**: Hardware costs $300+ (EUR 300)
- **Slow Development Cycle**: Test-build-upload-test iterations require physical device
- **Limited Debug Capability**: No desktop debugging tools, logging, or introspection
- **Ecosystem Limitation**: Only users who own hardware can test or use NT algorithms

### Specific Pain Points
1. **Developers**: Cannot efficiently debug plugins without hardware + physical upload cycle
2. **Musicians**: Cannot use NT algorithms in desktop DAW workflows (stuck to hardware only)
3. **Algorithm Creators**: Cannot collaborate remotely or use modern development tools
4. **Community**: Limited plugin ecosystem due to development friction

### Impact Metrics
- **Development Time**: 5-10x slower per algorithm without desktop testing
- **Accessibility**: Hardware requirement prevents ~95% of potential users from contributing
- **Community**: Minimal plugin ecosystem compared to open emulation platforms

## Proposed Solution

NT_EMU solves this through **faithful hardware emulation in desktop software**:

### Core Concept
Complete C++ implementation of the Disting NT hardware API running within VCV Rack, allowing unmodified NT algorithm plugins to execute on desktop with full fidelity.

### Key Differentiators
1. **100% API Compatibility**: Plugins run identically on hardware and emulator
2. **No Hardware Required**: Eliminate $300 barrier to entry
3. **Hot-Reload Support**: Instant feedback without restart cycles
4. **Exception Safety**: Plugin crashes don't crash host (unlike direct hardware)
5. **Desktop Integration**: Use with MIDI controllers, DAW automation, modulation

### Solution Architecture
- **Host**: VCV Rack 2.x synthesizer environment
- **Emulation Layer**: Complete NT C++ API implementation
- **Plugin System**: Secure plugin loading with error isolation
- **Integration**: Seamless VCV I/O, CV modulation, parameter automation
