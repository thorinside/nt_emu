---

## Section 1: Output Files Exist

**Pass Rate: 2/4 (50%)**

### ✓ PASS - PRD.md created in output folder
**Evidence:** File exists at docs/PRD-2025-10-19.md (lines 1-172)

### ✗ FAIL - epics.md created in output folder (separate file)
**Evidence:** File is named `epics-breakdown.md` not `epics.md`
**Impact:** Violates PRD checklist requirement for consistent naming. Expected: `epics.md`, Found: `epics-breakdown.md`
**Recommendation:** Rename to `docs/epics.md` OR update checklist to accept `epics-breakdown.md`

### ✓ PASS - bmm-workflow-status.md updated
**Evidence:** File exists at docs/bmm-workflow-status.md with current project state (lines 1-61)

### ✗ FAIL - No unfilled {{template_variables}}
**Evidence:** epics-breakdown.md:631 contains `{project-root}` variable reference
**Impact:** Template variable not expanded in reference section
**Recommendation:** Replace `{project-root}` with actual path or remove template syntax

---

## Section 2: PRD.md Core Quality

**Pass Rate: 8/8 (100%)**

### Requirements Coverage

### ✓ PASS - Functional requirements describe WHAT capabilities (not HOW to implement)
**Evidence:**
- FR001-FR010: Plugin functionality described without implementation details (lines 39-48)
- FR011-FR014: Distribution capabilities described at functional level (lines 51-54)
- FR015-FR018: Developer support described at outcome level (lines 57-59)

### ✓ PASS - Each FR has unique identifier (FR001, FR002, etc.)
**Evidence:** All 18 functional requirements numbered FR001-FR018 (lines 39-59)

### ✓ PASS - Non-functional requirements (if any) have business justification
**Evidence:** NFR001-NFR007 each includes measurable criteria and business rationale (lines 64-70)

### ✓ PASS - Requirements are testable and verifiable
**Evidence:** All FRs include specific acceptance criteria and measurable outcomes

### User Journeys

### ✓ PASS - User journeys reference specific FR numbers
**Evidence:** While FR numbers not explicitly referenced, journeys directly map to FR clusters:
- Journey 1 (Algorithm Developer) → FR015-FR018
- Journey 2 (End User) → FR011-FR014
- Journey 3 (Platform User) → NFR003

### ✓ PASS - Journeys show complete user paths through system
**Evidence:** All three journeys include numbered steps from discovery to completion (lines 77-106)

### ✓ PASS - Success outcomes are clear
**Evidence:** Each journey includes "Success Metric" with measurable outcomes (lines 85, 96, 106)

### Strategic Focus

### ✓ PASS - PRD focuses on WHAT and WHY (not technical HOW)
**Evidence:** PRD describes capabilities without implementation details; technical decisions deferred to architecture docs

### ✓ PASS - No specific technology choices in PRD (those belong in technical-decisions.md)
**Evidence:** No language-specific or framework-specific decisions in requirements; references existing architecture docs

### ✓ PASS - Goals are outcome-focused, not implementation-focused
**Evidence:** Goals section (lines 13-18) describes user/business outcomes, not technical milestones

---

## Section 3: epics.md Story Quality

**Pass Rate: 10/13 (77%)**

### Story Format

### ✓ PASS - All stories follow user story format
**Evidence:** All 8 stories include "As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]" format:
- Story 1.1 (lines 50-52)
- Story 1.2 (lines 119-122)
- Story 2.1 (lines 234-237)
- Story 2.2 (lines 280-283)
- Story 2.3 (lines 327-330)
- Story 2.4 (lines 355-358)
- Story 2.5 (lines 387-390)
- Story 2.6 (lines 438-441)
- Story 2.7 (lines 481-484)
- Story 2.8 (lines 532-535)

### ✓ PASS - Each story has numbered acceptance criteria
**Evidence:** All stories include numbered acceptance criteria sections (verified across all 10 stories)

### ✓ PASS - Prerequisites/dependencies explicitly stated
**Evidence:** All stories include "Prerequisites:" section or "Prerequisites: None" explicitly stated

### Story Sequencing (CRITICAL)

### ⚠ PARTIAL - Epic 1 establishes foundation
**Evidence:** Epic 1 (lines 30-213) focuses on "Finish DistingNT Feature Emulation"
**Gap:** This is a brownfield project at 92% completion. Epic 1 does NOT establish infrastructure foundation; it completes final features. However, checklist notes "Exception noted if adding to existing app" - this exception applies.
**Impact:** LOW - Acceptable for brownfield context, but should explicitly note brownfield status in epic overview

### ✓ PASS - Vertical slices: Each story delivers complete, testable functionality
**Evidence:** All stories include acceptance criteria, validation gates, and complete feature delivery:
- Story 1.1: Complete parameter sync feature with tests (lines 65-111)
- Story 1.2: Complete documentation deliverable (lines 129-211)
- Story 2.1-2.8: Each delivers platform-specific or cross-cutting complete capability

### ✗ FAIL - No forward dependencies: No story depends on work from a LATER story or epic
**Evidence:** Multiple forward dependency violations detected:
- Story 2.3 (CI/CD Pipeline) line 350: "Prerequisites: Stories 2.1, 2.2 complete" - VALID ✓
- Story 2.4 (Audio Determinism) line 379: "Prerequisites: Stories 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 complete" - VALID ✓
- Story 2.5 (Plugin Registry) line 429: "Prerequisites: Stories 2.1-2.4 complete" - VALID ✓
- Story 2.6 (User Guide) line 473: "Prerequisites: Stories 2.1-2.5 complete" - VALID ✓
- Story 2.7 (Community Infrastructure) line 524: "Prerequisites: Stories 2.5-2.6 complete" - VALID ✓
- Story 2.8 (Performance Validation) line 569: "Prerequisites: Stories 2.1-2.7 complete" - VALID ✓

**RETRACTION:** Upon deeper analysis, ALL dependencies are backward-looking (only on previous stories). NO forward dependencies detected.
**CORRECTION:** ✓ PASS - All dependencies reference only previous stories

### ✓ PASS - Stories are sequentially ordered within each epic
**Evidence:**
- Epic 1: Stories 1.1 → 1.2 (parameter implementation → documentation)
- Epic 2: Stories 2.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 → 2.4 → 2.5 → 2.6 → 2.7 → 2.8 (platform builds → CI → validation → release → docs → community → stability)

### ✓ PASS - Each story leaves system in working state
**Evidence:** All stories include validation gates confirming build success and test passage

### Coverage

### ✗ FAIL - All FRs from PRD.md are covered by stories in epics.md
**Evidence:** Missing FR coverage analysis:

**FR Coverage:**
- FR001-FR009: ✅ Covered by existing implementation (92% complete per workflow status)
- FR010: ✅ Covered by Story 1.1 (Real-time parameter sync)
- FR011: ⚠ PARTIAL - Plugin Browser submission covered by Story 2.5, but installation mechanism not explicitly detailed
- FR012: ✗ MISSING - "Algorithm discovery mechanism" not covered in Epic 1 or 2
- FR013: ✗ MISSING - "Algorithm versioning and dependency management" not covered
- FR014: ✗ MISSING - "One-click algorithm installation from plugin menu" not covered
- FR015: ⚠ PARTIAL - Story 2.6 covers user guide but not comprehensive algorithm development guide
- FR016: ✗ MISSING - "Example algorithms for common use cases" not covered
- FR017: ⚠ PARTIAL - Story 2.7 mentions algorithm submission but no detailed workflow
- FR018: ⚠ PARTIAL - API reference not explicitly mentioned in Story 2.6

**Impact:** CRITICAL - 4 FRs completely missing, 5 FRs only partially covered. Epic 2 focuses on plugin distribution but lacks algorithm ecosystem functionality (FR012-FR014, FR016).
**Recommendation:** Either (1) move FR012-FR014, FR016 to Epic 3 and update PRD to clarify Epic 2 scope, OR (2) add stories to Epic 2 covering algorithm discovery/installation

### ✗ FAIL - Epic list in PRD.md matches epics in epics.md (titles and count)
**Evidence:**
- PRD Epic 1: "Finish DistingNT Feature Emulation" ✅ MATCHES epics-breakdown.md line 30
- PRD Epic 2: "Multiplatform VCV Plugin Release" ✅ MATCHES epics-breakdown.md line 215
- PRD Epic 3: "Algorithm Ecosystem Expansion" ✅ MATCHES epics-breakdown.md line 572

**Story Count Mismatch:**
- PRD Epic 1 (lines 136-138): References "Story 2.6" and "Story 5.6"
- Epics file Epic 1 (lines 30-213): Contains "Story 1.1" and "Story 1.2"

**Impact:** CRITICAL - Story numbering inconsistency between PRD and epics file. PRD references old story IDs (2.6, 5.6) while epics file uses new IDs (1.1, 1.2).
**Recommendation:** Update PRD Epic 1 section to reference "Story 1.1" and "Story 1.2" instead of "Story 2.6" and "Story 5.6"

---

## Section 4: Cross-Document Consistency

**Pass Rate: 3/4 (75%)**

### ✓ PASS - Epic titles consistent between PRD.md and epics.md
**Evidence:** All three epic titles match exactly between documents

### ✗ FAIL - FR references in user journeys exist in requirements section
**Evidence:** User journeys do not explicitly reference FR numbers (lines 77-106). While journeys map conceptually to FRs, explicit traceability is missing.
**Impact:** MEDIUM - Reduces traceability between requirements and user value
**Recommendation:** Add FR references to journey steps, e.g., "Developer downloads DistingNT [FR011]"

### ✓ PASS - Terminology consistent across documents
**Evidence:** Consistent use of "DistingNT", "algorithm", "plugin", "VCV Rack", "emulator" across all documents

### ✓ PASS - No contradictions between PRD and epics
**Evidence:** Technical details and scope align across documents

---

## Section 5: Readiness for Next Phase

**Pass Rate: 2/2 (100%)**

### If Level 3-4:

### ✓ PASS - PRD provides sufficient context for solution-architecture workflow
**Evidence:** PRD includes technical NFRs, UX principles, and architecture references (lines 110-130, 64-70)

### ✓ PASS - Epic structure supports phased delivery approach
**Evidence:** Three-epic structure with clear dependencies and progressive value delivery (Epic 1: foundation → Epic 2: production → Epic 3: ecosystem)

### ✓ PASS - Clear value delivery path through epic sequence
**Evidence:** Epic sequencing principles clearly articulated (lines 20-26)

---

## Section 6: Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)

**Critical Failures: 2/7**

### ✗ FAIL - Epics.md file naming
**Finding:** File named `epics-breakdown.md` not `epics.md`
**Resolution Required:** Rename file OR update checklist to accept alternative naming

### ✓ PASS - Epic 1 establishes foundation
**Finding:** Brownfield exception applies - Epic 1 completes existing foundation

### ✓ PASS - Stories have no forward dependencies
**Finding:** All dependencies correctly reference only previous stories

### ✓ PASS - Stories are vertically sliced
**Finding:** All stories deliver complete, testable functionality

### ✓ PASS - No technical decisions in PRD
**Finding:** PRD correctly delegates technical decisions to architecture docs

### ✗ FAIL - Epics don't cover all FRs
**Finding:** 4 FRs missing (FR012-FR014, FR016), 5 FRs partially covered (FR011, FR015, FR017, FR018)
**Resolution Required:** Add stories or move FRs to Epic 3

### ✗ FAIL - User journeys don't reference FR numbers
**Finding:** No explicit FR traceability in journey steps
**Resolution Required:** Add FR references to journey steps

---

## Failed Items Summary

### CRITICAL Priority

1. **Missing FR Coverage** (Section 3)
   - FR012: Algorithm discovery mechanism
   - FR013: Algorithm versioning and dependency management
   - FR014: One-click algorithm installation
   - FR016: Example algorithms for common use cases
   - **Action:** Add stories to Epic 2 OR move to Epic 3 and update PRD scope

2. **Story ID Inconsistency** (Section 3)
   - PRD Epic 1 references old story IDs (2.6, 5.6)
   - Epics file uses new IDs (1.1, 1.2)
   - **Action:** Update PRD lines 136-138 to use new story IDs

3. **File Naming Convention** (Section 1)
   - Expected: `epics.md`
   - Found: `epics-breakdown.md`
   - **Action:** Rename to `epics.md` OR accept alternative naming

### HIGH Priority

4. **Missing FR Traceability** (Section 4)
   - User journeys lack explicit FR references
   - **Action:** Add FR numbers to journey steps

5. **Template Variables** (Section 1)
   - Unexpanded `{project-root}` variable in line 631
   - **Action:** Replace with actual path or remove template syntax

### MEDIUM Priority

6. **Partial FR Coverage** (Section 3)
   - FR011, FR015, FR017, FR018 only partially addressed
   - **Action:** Enhance story acceptance criteria to explicitly cover all aspects

---

## Partial Items Summary

1. **Epic 1 Foundation Role** (Section 3)
   - Brownfield context not explicitly noted
   - **Action:** Add note about brownfield status to Epic 1 overview

2. **Partial FR Coverage** (Section 3)
   - Five FRs (FR011, FR015, FR017, FR018) only partially covered
   - **Action:** Enhance story details to fully cover all FR aspects

---

## Recommendations

### Must Fix (Blocking Issues)

1. **Resolve FR Coverage Gaps**
   - Add Epic 2 stories for FR012-FR014, FR016 OR
   - Move these FRs to Epic 3 and update PRD to clarify Epic 2 scope as "plugin release" not "full ecosystem"
   - Recommended: Move to Epic 3 since workflow-status indicates 92% complete and ready for release

2. **Fix Story ID References in PRD**
   - Update PRD lines 136-138:
     - Change "Story 2.6" → "Story 1.1"
     - Change "Story 5.6" → "Story 1.2"

3. **Standardize File Naming**
   - Rename `epics-breakdown.md` → `epics.md`

### Should Improve (Important but not blocking)

4. **Add FR Traceability**
   - Insert FR references in user journey steps for full traceability

5. **Expand Template Variables**
   - Replace `{project-root}` in line 631 with actual path

6. **Enhance Partial FR Coverage**
   - Story 2.5: Explicitly mention FR011 one-click installation
   - Story 2.6: Split into "User Guide" and "Developer Guide" to fully cover FR015, FR018
   - Story 2.7: Add detailed algorithm submission workflow for FR017

### Consider (Minor improvements)

7. **Add Brownfield Context**
   - Add explicit note in Epic 1 overview: "Note: This is a brownfield project at 92% completion; Epic 1 completes final features rather than establishing initial foundation"

8. **Create Individual Story Files**
   - Per checklist expectations, create `/docs/stories/` directory with individual story markdown files
   - Follow dev-story checklist structure for each story

---

## Overall Assessment

**Status:** NOT READY FOR NEXT PHASE

**Critical Blockers:**
1. Missing FR coverage (4 FRs completely missing)
2. Story ID inconsistency between PRD and epics file
3. File naming non-compliance

**Strengths:**
- Excellent story format and structure
- Clear vertical slicing and sequential ordering
- Strong PRD quality with testable requirements
- Good cross-document terminology consistency
- Appropriate brownfield project approach

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours
- 1 hour: Resolve FR coverage (move to Epic 3, update PRD scope)
- 30 min: Fix story ID references
- 30 min: File rename and template variable cleanup
- 30 min: Add FR traceability to journeys
- 30 min: Review and validation

**Recommendation:** Address critical blockers before proceeding with implementation. The documentation is structurally sound but needs consistency fixes and scope clarification around algorithm ecosystem features.
