## Three Strategic Epics

### Epic 1: Finish DistingNT Feature Emulation
**Duration**: 1 week
**Priority**: CRITICAL (blocking Epic 2)
**Stories**: 2 implementation stories

1. **Story 1.1**: Real-time parameter synchronization (~1.5 hours)
   - Eliminate ~1ms delay between menu adjustment and audio routing
   - Improves UX, validates architectural assumptions

2. **Story 1.2**: Consolidate technical decisions documentation (~2.5 hours)
   - Document all major architectural choices (5+ decisions)
   - Enable new developer onboarding in < 1 hour
   - Provide template for future decisions

**Business Outcome**: 100% feature parity, technical foundation for ecosystem

---

### Epic 2: Multiplatform VCV Plugin Release
**Duration**: 3 weeks
**Priority**: CRITICAL (enables ecosystem growth)
**Stories**: 8 implementation stories

1. **Story 2.1**: Linux build validation (~3-4 hours)
2. **Story 2.2**: Windows build validation (~3-4 hours)
3. **Story 2.3**: CI/CD pipeline configuration (~2-3 hours)
4. **Story 2.4**: Audio determinism validation (~2-3 hours)
5. **Story 2.5**: Plugin registry submission (~2-3 hours)
6. **Story 2.6**: User guide & documentation (~3-4 hours)
7. **Story 2.7**: Community infrastructure setup (~2-3 hours)
8. **Story 2.8**: Performance & stability validation (~3-4 hours)

**Business Outcome**: Production-ready plugin in official registry, 1000+ downloads month 1, community infrastructure

---

### Epic 3: Algorithm Ecosystem Expansion (Planned)
**Duration**: 4 weeks
**Priority**: HIGH (realize full vision)
**Stories**: 6 planned stories (outline only)

1. Story 3.1: Port 20+ existing Disting NT algorithms
2. Story 3.2: Implement algorithm rating & review system
3. Story 3.3: Create algorithm developer workshop
4. Story 3.4: Establish algorithm publication workflow
5. Story 3.5: Grow community to 5000+ active users
6. Story 3.6: Implement algorithm marketplace

**Business Outcome**: Thriving community, 50+ algorithms, 5000+ active users, sustainable ecosystem

## Implementation Approach

### Development Model
- **Story-Driven**: Each story is independently implementable
- **Vertical Slices**: Complete end-to-end functionality per story
- **AI-Agent Compatible**: Stories designed for 2-4 hour focused implementation
- **No Forward Dependencies**: Each story builds only on previous work

### Quality Gates
- âœ… Build succeeds (`make clean && make`)
- âœ… All tests pass (16/16 unit tests)
- âœ… Code review approval
- âœ… Integration test on VCV Rack
- âœ… Documentation complete and reviewed

### Platform Testing
- macOS: Native dylib, codesigned, notarized
- Linux: glibc-compatible .so (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- Windows: MSVC DLL with Windows audio I/O

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Cross-platform build issues | Medium | Medium | Early Linux/Windows testing, CI/CD gating |
| Audio output variance | Low-Medium | High | Determinism tests, floating-point audit |
| Slow community adoption | Low-Medium | Medium | Strong marketing, tutorials, Discord |
| Algorithm quality issues | Medium | Low | Clear submission criteria, code review |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Sprint)
1. Review PRD-2025-10-19.md for alignment on vision
2. Review epics-breakdown.md for story-level clarity
3. Prioritize between Epic 1.1 and 1.2 for first implementation
4. Set up development environment

### Sprint Planning
- Sprint 1: Complete Epic 1 (2 stories, 1 week)
- Sprint 2-4: Complete Epic 2 (8 stories, 3 weeks)
- Sprint 5-8: Complete Epic 3 (6 stories, 4 weeks)

### Team Assignment
- **Neal** (owner): Epic 1 (feature completion), Epic 2.5 (registry), Epic 2.7 (community)
- **Community Contributors** (future): Algorithm porting (Epic 3.1), developer content
