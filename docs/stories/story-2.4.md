# Story 2.4: Audio Determinism Validation

**Epic:** 2 - Multiplatform VCV Plugin Release
**Story ID:** Epic-2.4
Status: Ready for Development
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

## User Story

As a user sharing presets across platforms,
I want identical audio output regardless of OS,
So that my music sounds the same on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

---

## Technical Requirements

- Record reference audio output on macOS
- Reproduce on Linux and verify bit-identical output
- Reproduce on Windows and verify bit-identical output
- Document any platform-specific variations
- Create automated audio validation test suite

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Audio output bit-identical across all platforms (within 10-6 floating point precision)
2. FFT analysis shows < 0.1dB variance across platforms
3. Phase alignment verified (phase difference < 0.1 degrees)
4. Performance metrics identical (< 0.5% variance)
5. Audio validation test suite automated
6. All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
