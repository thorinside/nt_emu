# Story 2.8: Performance & Stability Validation

**Epic:** 2 - Multiplatform VCV Plugin Release
**Story ID:** Epic-2.8
Status: Ready for Development
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours

---

## User Story

As a user relying on DistingNT in live performance,
I want the plugin to be rock-solid stable with zero crashes,
So that I can use it confidently in production contexts.

---

## Technical Requirements

- Memory profiling over 8+ hour session (detect leaks)
- CPU profiling under sustained load
- Stress testing (1000+ plugin load/unload cycles)
- Edge case handling (null inputs, extreme parameters)
- Cross-platform consistency validation

---

## Test Suite

```
Stability Test Suite:
├── Memory Leak Detection
│   └── 8 hour run with monitoring (target: < 10MB growth)
├── CPU Profile
│   └── 4-8 MIDI algorithms simultaneously (target: < 5% variance)
├── Plugin Load/Unload Cycle
│   └── 1000x plugin instantiation (target: zero crashes)
├── Audio Latency
│   └── Measure across all sample rates 44.1k-96k (target: < 1ms)
└── Platform Consistency
    └── FFT comparison of audio output (target: < 0.1dB variance)
```

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Zero memory growth over 8 hour session (< 10MB growth acceptable)
2. CPU usage stable (variance < 5%)
3. Audio latency consistently < 1ms
4. Zero crashes in 1000+ load/unload cycles
5. Platform audio variance < 0.1dB
6. No edge cases crash the plugin
7. Performance consistent across all three platforms
