- Configuration should be flexible

**Rationale**:
- NtEmu acts as a coordinator container
- Components receive dependencies rather than creating them
- Enables substitution of implementations
- Supports testing with mock objects
- Clear dependency graph makes debugging easier

**Implementation**:
```cpp
class NtEmu : public Module {
private:
    std::unique_ptr<PluginManager> pluginMgr;
    std::unique_ptr<ParameterSystem> paramSystem;
    std::unique_ptr<MenuSystem> menuSystem;
    std::unique_ptr<MidiProcessor> midiProc;
    std::unique_ptr<DisplayRenderer> displayRend;

    // Constructor wires dependencies
};
```

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Gained: Loosely coupled components
- ✅ Gained: Testable in isolation
- ⚠️ Cost: Slightly more complex initialization

**Validation**: Components compile independently ✅

## ADR-004: 28-Bus Fixed Audio Architecture

**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTED & IMPLEMENTED

**Decision**: Implement a fixed 28-bus architecture matching Disting NT hardware capabilities.

**Context**:
- Disting NT hardware provides 28 buses for flexible signal routing
- Buses are voltage carriers (-12V to +12V), not signal-type specific
- Algorithms determine how buses are used - no fixed assignments

**Bus Allocation (Hardware Specification)**:
```
Buses 0-11  (NT 1-12):   Hardware inputs (from VCV jacks)
Buses 12-19 (NT 13-20):  Hardware outputs (to VCV jacks)
Buses 20-27 (NT 21-28):  Auxiliary buses (inter-algorithm communication)

All buses carry identical voltage signals - any can be audio, CV, or modulation
Signal type is determined by algorithm usage, not bus number
```

**Rationale**:
- Matches NT hardware specification exactly
- Flexible routing enables complex algorithm interactions
- No artificial restrictions on signal types per bus
- Auxiliary buses allow algorithms to pass signals between each other

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Gained: Perfect hardware compatibility
- ✅ Gained: Maximum routing flexibility for algorithms
- ✅ Gained: Inter-algorithm communication capability
- ⚠️ Responsibility: Algorithms must manage their own routing

**Validation**: All routing scenarios tested, matches NT hardware behavior ✅

## ADR-005: Exception-Safe Plugin Execution

**Status**: ✅ ACCEPTED & IMPLEMENTED

**Decision**: Wrap all plugin execution in try-catch to prevent plugin crashes from affecting host.

**Context**:
- Plugins are third-party code, potentially buggy
- Plugin crash must not crash VCV Rack or lose user work
- Need graceful degradation on errors

**Implementation**:
```cpp
try {
    plugin->process(context);
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    logError("Plugin crashed: " + e.what());
    enterBypassMode();  // Audio passes through silently
    displayError();      // Show user notification
}
```

**Safety Levels**:
1. ✅ Exception catching (std::exception)
2. ✅ Nullptr checks before use
3. ✅ Parameter validation and bounds checking
4. ✅ Audio thread safety (no locks in hot path)
5. ⚠️ Future: Process isolation (deferred to Phase 2)

**Rationale**:
- Protects ecosystem stability
- Enables community plugin development
- Reduces development friction
- Enables rapid iteration

**Trade-offs**:
- ✅ Gained: System stability
- ✅ Gained: Ecosystem health
- ⚠️ Cost: Minor overhead from exception handling
- ⚠️ Limited: Only exception-based isolation

**Validation**:
- Crash test plugins tested ✅
- No host crashes observed ✅
- Graceful degradation confirmed ✅

- Fewer controls requires mode-based navigation
- Parameters hidden by default, revealed in menu

**Menu Modes**:
```
OFF                  - Normal playing, no menu
  └─ L.ENC PRESS → PAGE_SELECT
     │
     └─ Navigate menu pages with L.ENC
        └─ L.ENC PRESS → PARAM_SELECT
           │
           └─ Navigate parameters with L.ENC
              └─ L.ENC PRESS → VALUE_EDIT
                 │
                 └─ Adjust value with R.ENC
                    └─ L.ENC PRESS → OFF (apply & exit)
```

**Rationale**:
- Hardware-familiar interface reduces learning curve
- Progressive disclosure manages complexity
- Clear state transitions prevent confusion
- Encoder-based control matches hardware

**Implementation**:
