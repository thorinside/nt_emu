# Epic 1: Finish DistingNT Feature Emulation

**Epic ID:** EPIC-001-FEATURE-COMPLETION
**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** Critical (Blocker for Epic 2 production release)
**Effort:** 3-4 story points
**Duration:** 1 week

---

## Epic Goal

Complete all remaining DistingNT hardware feature implementations (92% → 100%) and consolidate architectural decisions to enable ecosystem growth. This epic captures the final technical refinements before production release.

## Epic Value Proposition

**For Users:** Zero-latency parameter response and complete feature parity with hardware provides professional-quality user experience.

**For Developers:** Centralized technical decisions documentation reduces onboarding time from 1 day to <1 hour, enabling rapid team scaling.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Real-time parameter synchronization implemented (< 1 sample block latency)
- [ ] All 16 unit tests passing
- [ ] Build succeeds without warnings on macOS
- [ ] CPU profiling shows no performance regression
- [ ] Technical decisions documented covering 6+ major architectural choices
- [ ] New developer can understand architecture in < 1 hour using documentation
- [ ] Integration test confirms parameter changes apply immediately

## Stories in Epic 1

### Story 1.1: Real-Time Parameter Synchronization

**As a** parameter-tweaking musician,
**I want** parameter changes to apply to audio routing instantly,
**So that** I experience zero lag between menu adjustment and audio effect.

**Story Points:** 1.5 hours

### Story 1.2: Consolidate Technical Decisions Documentation

**As a** new developer joining the team,
**I want** to understand all major architectural decisions and their rationale,
**So that** I can make informed decisions when extending the system without reading 25 PRPs.

**Story Points:** 2.5 hours

## Story Dependencies

```
Story 1.1 (Parameter Sync) ─┐
Story 1.2 (Documentation)   ├─── Both independent, can parallelize
                            │
                            ↓
                    Epic 1 Complete
                            ↓
                    Epic 2 Unblocked
```

## Timeline

**Timeline:**
- Sequential: 4 hours
- With parallelization: 2.5 hours (recommended)
- Recommended: Complete within 1 day

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Parameter sync introduces regression | Low | Medium | Comprehensive validation gates, CPU profiling |
| Documentation incomplete or unclear | Low | Low | Developer review loop, clear structure with 6 decisions |
| Timeline slippage | Very Low | Low | Small scope (2 stories, 4 hours total) |
| Performance degradation | Very Low | Medium | Existing lock-free design, profiling validation |

## Technical Context

### Current State (92% Complete)
- ✅ Plugin loading system operational
- ✅ Display rendering (256x64 OLED emulation)
- ✅ Audio routing (28-bus architecture)
- ✅ MIDI I/O
- ✅ Parameter system
- ✅ Menu navigation
- ⚠️ Parameter sync has ~1ms delay (Story 1.1 addresses)
- ⚠️ Technical decisions scattered (Story 1.2 addresses)

### Components Involved
- **ParameterSystem** (`vcv-plugin/src/parameter/ParameterSystem.hpp/cpp`)
- **MenuSystem** (`vcv-plugin/src/menu/MenuSystem.hpp/cpp`)
- **Documentation** (`docs/technical-decisions.md` - new file)
