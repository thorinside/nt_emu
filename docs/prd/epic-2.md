## Success Criteria

- [ ] Plugin builds successfully on macOS, Linux, Windows with zero warnings
- [ ] All 16 unit tests pass on all three platforms
- [ ] Audio output bit-identical across platforms (< 0.1dB variance)
- [ ] Plugin listed in official VCV Plugin Browser
- [ ] One-click install functional for end users
- [ ] User documentation complete (installation + usage + development guides)
- [ ] Community infrastructure operational (GitHub Issues + Discussions + Discord)
- [ ] 8+ hour stability validation passes (< 10MB memory growth, zero crashes)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline operational with automated builds and tests

## Timeline

**Timeline with Parallelization:**
- Sequential (no parallelization): 3-4 weeks
- Optimal (Stories 2.1 & 2.2 parallel): 3 weeks
- Recommended: 3 weeks with 2.1/2.2 parallelization

**Week 1:** Stories 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
**Week 2:** Stories 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
**Week 3:** Stories 2.7, 2.8

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Windows build issues (unfamiliar platform) | Medium | High | Early validation, community testing |
| Audio determinism fails across platforms | Low | High | Rigorous FFT analysis, automated validation |
| VCV Plugin Registry rejection | Low | High | Schema validation, pre-submission review |
| Documentation gaps lead to support burden | Medium | Medium | User testing, comprehensive FAQ |
| CI/CD pipeline complexity | Low | Medium | Use GitHub Actions templates, incremental setup |
| Timeline slippage due to platform issues | Medium | Medium | 8 stories over 3 weeks provides buffer |
| Community infrastructure setup complexity | Low | Low | Use established templates (GitHub, Discord) |
